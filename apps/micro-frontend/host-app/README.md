# Host App

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript + ESLint template for building micro-frontends. It uses the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool, [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the UI, and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety. The template also includes [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and code quality checks.
